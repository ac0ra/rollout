Rollout

Automated backup / deployment tool.
- backup guest to tar / image / snapshot (selectable, also auto mode).
- convert backup to different types.
- convert backup to stage4 (automated cleanup with plugins and scripts).
- deployment tools (deployment agent, iso, kernel/initramfs or standalone).
- stage4diff (execute scripts within chroot or deployed form to fork a stage4, store file differences or whole forked tar).


---- Backup process.
-- Detect host state, start collecting metadata.
-- connect to destination to collect backup rules (if desired).
-- create file list / index.
-- run pre-backup scripts.
-- verify index and create diff post scripts.
-- setup connection to destination (if not already for pre-config, destination end may be local or remote via socket, udp/tcp or zmq).
-- backup partition table and bootloaders.
-- backup boot partition.
-- backup root partition.
-- backup other partitions (basic rules exclude swap and other not really backup appropriate partitions; instead their partitions are stored as tag to re-create them).
-- verify index and create diff post backups to detect any changes.
-- send perf data to destination and either wait for destination, or hangup.


----- Conversion Process.
-- read metadata, determine os image type.
-- create temporary dirs.
-- mount image / extract tar.
-- index, verify against stored index.
-- create destination container and mirror meta data onto any appropriate settings.
-- copy file system to destination preserving contents (file by file).
-- verify index, store diff.
--IF- for stage4 conversion also perform cleanup scripts on destination inside chroot before tar creation.




---- Stage4 diff.
-- compare two stage4 tars (compare tar to index, index to index, or tar to tar).
-- create tar.patch.


--- stage4 fork.
-- create forks of stage4, appyling customizations via scripts and plugins to an agent executed during the operation  (either via a chroot, or via an automated deployment system of sorts).
-- Then uses stage4 diff to create a tar patch, or can be used on its own to create automated forks of a stage4.
